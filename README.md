# Oregon Forest Fire Analysis

<p>In this exploratory analysis of Oregon forest fires between the years 2000-2022, we uncovered the most common causes of these fires throughout the years, the total acreage burned thoughout the years, as well as the total acerage burned each year and where. While searching for a data source we discovered that the Oregon Department of Forestry had collected fire data from 2000-2022, and posted it to Data.gov for public use. This allowed us to download the complete CSV file and begin our cleaning and analysis portion of the project.</p>

# How we got our data:

<p>Utilizing DataFrames though Pandas, we were able to separate the necessary columns to allow us to begin sorting and plotting our data using Matplotlib, through four different visualization tactics, we were able to come to a few different conclusions.</p>

# Our Findings:

<p>While lighting was the most common cause of fires over the 22 years, we noticed that there were some years that human negligence, such as equipment use and debris burning, actually had caused more fires than the more common lightning. We also notice that 2 disticts, Southwest and central Oregon had the most amount of fires per year, they're also consistantly leading the data with most acerage burned, while most of the other districts were more random in their amounts and acerage over the years.</p>
